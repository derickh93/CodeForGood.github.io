Good Morning Mr. Bully Juice,

My name is Derick Hansraj and I'm a big fan of yours. I've followed you since I began working out last year. My coworker introduced me to your channel. Last year I was diagnosed with covid-19 and after I recovered I decided to get fit. I work at a hospital in New York that has a gym in the basement which is very convenient. Since last year I've lost almost 60 pounds thanks to your channel.

 The reason for reaching out is that I just graduated with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I want to build you an app. I'm looking to gain experience and build a portfolio. It is so hard and competitive to find a job now without the relevant experience. To be frank, I can't afford to intern for free/ minimum wage. I thought why not try to build my portfolio around projects that excite me. Hence that is why I'm reaching out to you. I look forward to hear your thoughts on the matter and in the meantime I'll keep getting those gain!

Thank You,
Derick Hansraj
